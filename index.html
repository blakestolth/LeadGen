Of course. To make your website layout and form look more professional, you should focus on simplifying the user experience, improving visual hierarchy, and refining the spacing and flow. The current design is functional, but a few key adjustments can elevate it significantly.

Here's my advice to create a more professional-looking website while keeping the same content.

General Layout and Design
Your overall layout is clean and mobile-friendly, which is great. Here are a few high-level tweaks to enhance its professionalism.

Refine Spacing and Whitespace: Add more vertical space between sections (<section>). A little extra breathing room makes content easier to digest and gives the site a more premium feel. For example, increase the space-y-8 on your <main> container to space-y-12 or space-y-16.

Strengthen Visual Hierarchy: Your main headline, "Get driving in 3 easy steps," is good, but the "Fastest Online Approval" headline on the right competes with it. Consider making the "3 easy steps" the undisputed primary headline and styling the "Fastest Online Approval" as a secondary headline or a feature highlight.

Improve the "Trust Badges": The "Partnered with Kot Auto Group" and "5-star Google reviews" badges feel a bit disconnected. Instead of placing them in separate bordered boxes at the bottom of each column, integrate them more naturally. You could place them side-by-side beneath the "3 easy steps" or just above the main call-to-action button, without the large badge containers. This makes them feel like endorsements rather than separate content blocks.

The Application Form
The form is the most critical part of the user journey on this site. The goal is to make it feel shorter, simpler, and more intuitive. A 10-step process, even if the steps are small, can feel intimidating.

1. Simplify the Multi-Step Experience
The biggest improvement you can make is to reduce the perceived number of steps. Users are more likely to complete a form that feels short and straightforward.

Combine Related Steps: Group related questions onto a single screen.

Step 1 & 2: Ask for "Vehicle Type" and "Used or New?" on the same screen.

Step 6, 7, 9: Combine "Contact Info," "About You (DOB)," and "Address" into a single "Personal Information" step. Most users expect to fill this out all at once.

Re-think the "Application Path": The "Choose your path" step (Credit Inquiry vs. Full Application) is confusing. It adds a moment of hesitation. It would be more professional to have one clear path. Offer a single, streamlined application and explain in the intro text that it's a "quick pre-approval form to see your options." This removes friction.

2. Improve Input Field Design and Layout
Clear, well-organized fields make a form easier and faster to complete.

Use More Descriptive Labels and Placeholders:

For the Monthly income field, use a placeholder like "e.g., 4000" instead of "$3,500" to avoid confusion about including characters like '$' or commas.

Make optional fields explicitly clear. The current (Optional) text for the middle name is good.

Enhance Layout for Scannability:

In the "Contact Info" section, a two-column layout (sm:grid-cols-2) for Name/Phone/Email is better than the current three-column layout. This creates a more natural vertical rhythm (First Name, Last Name, Phone, Email).

For the "Date of Birth," use a single input field with a date picker (<input type="date">) where possible, or ensure the three separate fields (Month, Day, Year) are clearly grouped under one label.

Improve Visual Feedback:

Your .selected class for tiles is good. Ensure the transition is smooth.

For standard text inputs, consider adding a subtle checkmark icon inside the field on successful validation to give users positive reinforcement as they go.

3. Refine the Progress Bar and Navigation
The progress bar is a great feature, but it can be improved.

Reduce the Step Count: By combining steps as suggested above, your progress bar might only have 4 or 5 steps instead of 10. This makes the user feel like they are making more significant progress with each click.

Add "Back" Functionality: A professional form should always allow users to go back and change a previous answer without restarting. Add a subtle "Back" button next to the "Next" button on each step.

Clearer Final Call-to-Action (CTA): The final step should have a single, prominent button that says something clear and compelling like "Get My Options" or "Submit Application". Avoid generic "Next" or "Continue" buttons on the final step.
